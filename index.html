            You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover
            pages, and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts,
            or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can
            easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text
            by choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on the
            Home tab. You can also format text directly by using the other controls on the
            Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the current theme
            or using a format that you specify directly. To change the overall look of your
            document, choose new Theme elements on the Page Layout tab. To change the looks
            available in the Quick Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set
            command. Both the Themes gallery and the Quick Styles gallery provide reset
            commands so that you can always restore the look of your document to the
            original contained in your current template. On the Insert tab, the galleries
            include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your
